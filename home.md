We are a collection of washed-up baseball players that have taken our careers overseas. What we lack in talent, we make up for in experience and a damn good story or two. Here we've compiled some of our most interesting recollections of our time abroad, and we hope to share a few lessons and a few laughs along with our readers. For now we plan to share our experiences through this blog, but one day we just may end up on your coffee table. 

Feel free to poke around or peruse the categories. We're willing to bet there's one that'll put a smile on your face.
